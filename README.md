Welcome to the Battleships is a game of logic, with players attempting to sink each others fleet by guessing co-ordinates.
This version uses a a board generated using Python lists and incorporates a logic engine to allow the computer to fire back at the user.

## Project Goals 
The project goal is to create a logic game using Python.
### User Goals
The application user wants to play a logic game.

### Site Owner Goals
The Battleships game is played on grids on which each player's fleet of battleships are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players call shots at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.
The application provides a working battleships game for a single user to play against the computer.
